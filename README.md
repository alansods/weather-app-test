## Technologies used

- Vue 2;
- Vue Router;
- Vuex;
- CSS.

## Libraries used

- Axios;
- Date-fns;
- Vue-toasted.

## APIs used
- OpenWeather

## Chalanges faced

- Learn to work with an API that I've never used before. Solved by studying the documentation;
- Build an application with only an incomplete interface sketch and no interactive prototype. Solved by creating the missing parts with my design skills;
- Short deadline. Solved by separating the work in small steps and managing time;
- Limitations from the free version of the openweather API. Solved by improvising some details.

## Lessons learned during the project
- Work with openweather API;
- Discovered about with navigator geolocation;
- Discovered about vue-toasted;
- Learned new stuff about date-fns.

## Future improvements
- Refactor some partes of the code to avoid repeated code and css.
